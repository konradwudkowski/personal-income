/**
  * Parses formatted monetary amounts as output by personal-tax-summary into
  * BigDecimals.
  *
  * We do this so that we can send the amounts to the mobile apps in numeric
  * format so that the apps can decide how to format them.
  *
  * Ideally personal-tax-summary would not format the amounts and instead
  * return them as numeric values, leaving it to the UIs to format them (because
  * the UIs are likely to have better knowledge of the user's locale and
  * preferences). We hope to move to this design in future.
  *
  * NOT THREAD SAFE because each instance uses a DecimalFormat.
